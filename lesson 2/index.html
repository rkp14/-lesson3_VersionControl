            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Universal Resource Locator (URL) is used as a web site's or files individual address. Similar to a home address it can be broken into several different parts which help one discover more about the specific address. The first section, “http://” is the hypertext transfer protocol it is a common language for servers and devices. The second section “www.” stands for the “world wide web” and is the host name. The third section “domain” is the specific domain name hosted on that particular network, domain names can be purchased and each domain name is unique in its top level. The second to last section is a top level domain name, some examples are: .org, .com, .edu. The last part is the path to the subpage or file or webpage, this part is optional depending on the the website, for example the home page of a website may not have this part. URL addresses interest me because they are part of my everyday life and will be used throughout this course for submitting coursework and for course resources. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">An Internet Protocol (IP) Address is a digital numerical address linked to every electronic device that accesses the Internet. It can be traced to link an individual or organisation to accessing a certain site or service on the Internet. On public, corporate, mobile and unprotected wireless connections the IP address may not identify the exact person through a digital trace. In a home or small business router often only one IP address is displayed for all the people connected to it; therefore, the IP address will not identify a specific person, but the general group of people that had access to it. Overall an IP address can help aid what specific people did online, but it can be difficult and tricky to trace using only an IP address. IP addresses interest me because I think it is fascinating that one can track what people do online and are useful in understanding better how the internet works which aids me in my coursework for this class. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Topic 3: Email </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Trips to the post office have been significantly cut do to electronic mail (e-mail.) E-mail (like mail) is messages sent by one specific sender to another or a group of recipients. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is built on the Internet Protocol (like HTTP) and is in charge of transferring messages. When a person writes an e-mail on a webmail server (such as gmail or yahoo) or in an e-mail program (such as outlook) using SMTP it is then sent to an outgoing e-mail server. From there using SMTP it is next transferred from one web server to another until it finally reaches its final destination, similar to airport transfers. E-mail servers knows where to send the messages and when the message reaches its final destination by looking at its Domain Name System (DNS) information. All e-mail addresses have a domain, which comes after the @ symbol and the DNS deals with knowing which servers are responsible for dealing with e-mails from each domain. When the e-mail reaches its final destination it will remain there for the recipient to move or delete as they please. I have been sending e-mail since the 4th grade and it is really interesting to now know and understand how they work. E-mails are essential to attending university in the year 2016 for student-professor and student-student communication which will aid me in this course. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Topic 4: The Cloud</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The term “cloud” in the concept of Cloud Computing is used to represent the network that is outside of the network of the user. Cloud Computing is used to describe a computing service that works inside a network instead of inside the end-users computer. Many think of the “cloud” as a new concept, but it has actually be around and used for quite a while. A good example and one of the first users is webmail (services such as gmail and yahoo.) Users have access to their e-mails on any device with internet (as long as they remember their log-in information!) instead of only being able to access their mail on one single device. Due to expensive hard-drive storage and faster internet connection speeds the cloud is increasing in popularity. People can now pay for services to store data (such as pictures) on virtual hard disks offered by different providers (such as Microsoft Live and Apple Photos.) Online office softwares and databases are also becoming more popular on the cloud. I find the cloud interesting and very useful, as a busy student it is easy to pull up my work saved in the Google Drive cloud on any computer on campus, for example I wrote my first drafts of my paragraphs for each topic for this lesson on a school computer using Google Drive. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Topic 5: Search Engines</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When my parents had to look up information for school projects growing up they had to go to a library or access to hard copy sets of encyclopedias. As I was growing up I usually used the Internet. Tools such as Google Seach Engine make simple inquiries fast and easy. If I have a question for my mom, half the time she just tells me to google it. Search Engines can be thought of as index cards on the internet, but they are not centrally organized; therefore, search engines are extremely helpful and important in aiding users to navigate online. The most common and used search engine service is the crawler-based model which uses software to search for what is online and then it organizes and indexes the content. The World Wide Web can be navigated through hyperlinks, which are texts or images which when clicked on will lead to another website. All web authors can link to another online content which can aid in linking Internet users to similar topics and organizing information. Search Engines are relevant to this course as an added useful resource for additional inquiries on class topics. </p>
